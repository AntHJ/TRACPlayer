### Notes
Due to the slow WiFi speeds of the Vita, please be patient when navigating the various pages and also when downloading the audio files.
Also, due to limitations with LPP, not all of the audio files are playable, so the app may crash as it tries to play the incompatible file..

You are still able to download the audio and then use VitaShell or [ElevenMPV](https://github.com/GrapheneCt/ElevenMPV-A) to play the saved tracks.
You can install ElevenMPV from the TRAC Player app itself.
